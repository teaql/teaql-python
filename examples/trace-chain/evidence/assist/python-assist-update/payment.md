# Python Assist — Update `Payment`

Load the current generated entity so its stored ID and original version
participate in optimistic locking. Never reconstruct it from untrusted JSON.

An entity update is not a partial DTO patch. Load every scalar field before
modification so checker rules can validate the complete business state. Never
use the `_minimal()` request or a reduced projection for an entity that will be saved.

```python
from Q import Q

async def update_payment(
        context,
        entity_id,
        reference_code,
        throw_if_missing=False):
    entity = await (Q.payments()
        .with_id_is(entity_id)

        .comment("what: load current Payment for update")
        .purpose("why: preserve original version for optimistic locking")
        .execute_for_one(context))
    if entity is None:
        if throw_if_missing:
            raise LookupError("Payment not found: " + str(entity_id))
        return None

    entity.update_reference_code(reference_code)

    await entity.audit_as(
        "Update Payment for the requested business operation").save(context)
    return entity
```

Compile and execute this source unchanged. Prove persistence and query-back, a
conflict from an independently loaded stale copy, None and throwing not-found
behavior, missing/blank audit rejection, and failure for unknown or trusted
fields. Constant and relation changes require an explicitly selected generated
method; do not guess one.

## TeaQL seven-language assist contract

Apply the verified Rust semantic ceiling while using only the exact PYTHON generated and
runtime APIs. Discover APIs through the generated application AGENTS.md and progressive
model-aware Assist. Do not inspect generated domain-library source.

- Do not create plurals by appending `s` or `es`; use the centralized generated plural.
- Human and non-human entities use different generated predicate vocabularies. Preserve
  forms such as “who are active” and “whose email is”; never infer them from English.
- Configure filters, projection, paging, and other query options before `purpose(...)`.
  Comment may appear anywhere in the chain. Purpose enters the executable stage; execution
  requires both values, but comment does not have to immediately precede purpose.
- Every execute/list/stream and every save accepts exactly one context argument:
  `UserContext`. Name that argument `context`, never `runtime`; data services and global
  policy are injected when the context is built. Reserve `runtime` for process-level
  runtime ownership, provider/pool setup, and module assembly.
- Tenant, merchant, identity, permissions, request policy, purpose policy, hard limit,
  and continuous-page cursor policy come only from trusted context, never dynamic JSON or TFP.
- If the required operation is absent after current entity/action and required field
  Assist, stop that path and report MISSING_ASSIST. Do not guess an API or search the
  generated library as a fallback.
- Create each application-owned source file once. After its first compile attempt,
  repair only the smallest block identified by the exact compiler or test diagnostic.
  Preserve unrelated code; do not rewrite the complete file as an error-recovery loop.
- Before a repair that would replace more than 25% of an existing application file,
  stop and report LARGE_REWRITE_REQUEST with the file, exact diagnostic, reason, and
  estimated scope. Initial creation and model-driven regeneration are not repairs.

Capability: `update`.

- Load the tenant-scoped current entity first so its original version participates
  in optimistic locking; do not reconstruct versioned state from untrusted JSON.
- Allow-list writable fields, attach the generated audit-reason API, and save with
  the same UserContext. Add a stale-version rejection test.
