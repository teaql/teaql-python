# Python Assist — Create `OrderItem`

Use the exact generated `Q.order_items()` entry point. Trusted actor,
tenant, policy, provider, initialization, and audit infrastructure belong to
`UserContext`, never to business input.

```python
from Q import Q


async def create_order_item(
    customer_order,
    name,
    context,
):
    entity = (
        Q.order_items()
        .comment("what: initialize Order Item")
        .purpose("why: create Order Item")
        .new_entity(context)
    )

    entity.update_customer_order(customer_order)
    entity.update_name(name)

    await entity.audit_as(
        "Create Order Item for the requested business operation"
    ).save(context)
    return entity
```

Only the generated updater methods above are writable. Constant candidates,
when present, use these exact allow-listed public methods:

Compile and execute the source unchanged. Verify persistence and query-back.
Missing/blank intent, missing/blank audit reason, unknown fields, and attempted
trusted-context overrides must fail. Do not edit generated sources.

## TeaQL seven-language assist contract

Apply the verified Rust semantic ceiling while using only the exact PYTHON generated and
runtime APIs. Discover APIs through the generated application AGENTS.md and progressive
model-aware Assist. Do not inspect generated domain-library source.

- Do not create plurals by appending `s` or `es`; use the centralized generated plural.
- Human and non-human entities use different generated predicate vocabularies. Preserve
  forms such as “who are active” and “whose email is”; never infer them from English.
- Configure filters, projection, paging, and other query options before `purpose(...)`.
  Comment may appear anywhere in the chain. Purpose enters the executable stage; execution
  requires both values, but comment does not have to immediately precede purpose.
- Every execute/list/stream and every save accepts exactly one context argument:
  `UserContext`. Name that argument `context`, never `runtime`; data services and global
  policy are injected when the context is built. Reserve `runtime` for process-level
  runtime ownership, provider/pool setup, and module assembly.
- Tenant, merchant, identity, permissions, request policy, purpose policy, hard limit,
  and continuous-page cursor policy come only from trusted context, never dynamic JSON or TFP.
- If the required operation is absent after current entity/action and required field
  Assist, stop that path and report MISSING_ASSIST. Do not guess an API or search the
  generated library as a fallback.
- Create each application-owned source file once. After its first compile attempt,
  repair only the smallest block identified by the exact compiler or test diagnostic.
  Preserve unrelated code; do not rewrite the complete file as an error-recovery loop.
- Before a repair that would replace more than 25% of an existing application file,
  stop and report LARGE_REWRITE_REQUEST with the file, exact diagnostic, reason, and
  estimated scope. Initial creation and model-driven regeneration are not repairs.

Capability: `create`.

- Validate and allow-list writable business fields; never mass-assign dynamic JSON.
- Create through the generated request/entity API, attach a non-empty audit reason,
  save with the same UserContext, and return the runtime's native save result.
- Add a negative test proving a missing audit reason cannot write.
